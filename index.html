      <div class="about" id="about">

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My journey in technology began with a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which inspired me to pursue a career in Software Engineering. This passion led me to Zetech University, where I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Software Engineering, equipping myself with the skills needed to develop innovative digital solutions.

            To further enhance my expertise, I am attending the Power Learn Project (PLP) boot camp, where I am actively learning HTML, CSS, Python, and databases, gaining hands-on experience in modern web development. In addition to this, my studies at Zetech University have provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, VB.NET, and JavaScript, allowing me to explore various aspects of software development and problem-solving.
            
            As I continue to build my skills, I am committed to creating efficient, user-friendly, and impactful digital solutions. I have a keen interest in both web development and software engineering, ensuring that the applications I build are not only visually appealing but also highly functional.
            
            Beyond coding, my creativity extends into graphic design and graphite and charcoal pencil art, which enhance my ability to approach development with a unique and artistic perspective. My goal is to merge technology and creativity to develop solutions that solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact.
            
            I believe in lifelong learning, collaboration, and innovation, and I am always eager to embrace new challenges as I grow in the tech industry.</p>
